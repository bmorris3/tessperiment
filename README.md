Experiments with [TESS alerts](https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/tess-data-alerts/) by [Brett Morris (UW)](http://brettmorr.is).

##### TIC 52368076 [b](https://archive.stsci.edu/hlsps/tess-data-alerts/hlsp_tess-data-alerts_tess_phot_00052368076-s01s02-01_tess_v1_dvs.pdf) and [c](https://archive.stsci.edu/hlsps/tess-data-alerts/hlsp_tess-data-alerts_tess_phot_00052368076-s01s02-02_tess_v1_dvs.pdf)

Multiplanet system with 2:1 period ratio. I fit TIC 52368076 for transit timing variations, and find that the innermost planet has at least one significant departure from a linear ephemeris, but there are insufficient measurements to constrain the masses of the planets. 

##### [TIC 260271203](https://archive.stsci.edu/hlsps/tess-data-alerts/hlsp_tess-data-alerts_tess_phot_00260271203-s01s02-01_tess_v1_dvs.pdf)

This planet appears to be orbiting a star with the following properties: Rstar: 1.21, Teff: 5963.0 K, Logg: 4.31, and appears to have a secondary with a very deep transit depth. Here I test whether or not the large radius can be explained by unocculted starspots in the vein of [Morris et al 2018](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AJ....156...91M) and find that the most likely radius of the planet from ingress/egress duration is still quite large.
